Exploration Filing Adjustments:
- Adding code to file figures dynamically, depending on exploration run number

pipeline.py:
	- Removed generate_stratified_sample method, only used for exploration so included in run_exploration method
	- Added run_number argument for run_exploration. Index for data visual / progress

processing.py:
	- Amended method for getting growth_features in year 2018
	- Now using updated method of feature retrieval

exploration.py:
	- exploration_filing method added
	- We can now store figures from exploration of data before and after processing, for example
	- method checks for exploration run number directory, adds if does not exist
	- Figures are then stored in corresponding run number dir
	- Adjusted file save paths
