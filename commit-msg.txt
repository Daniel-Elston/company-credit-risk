Initial Explorations: exploration.py

- Performed some quick exploration of the dataset
- Prototype methods for stratified sampling, combining_datetimes, sorting and selecting
- Plans to engineer features and perform PCA, result in stashing of progress to focus on processing.py first

Other:
	- Created sample.xlsx for quick view of data
	- create_pq_file method added to make_dataset.py
	- Adjusted duplicate_count in quality_assessment.py report generation
