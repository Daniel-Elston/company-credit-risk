Resource Management (complete):
- General restructuring and reformatting of code for optimisation

correlations.py:
	- Added load/save_path class attr
	- Now using .parq instead of .csv

dist_analysis.py
	- Added df.copy() to analyze_column method
	- Now utilising a stratified sampled dataframe
	- Removed skew/kurt_weight arguments as they were not being implementd correctly

eigenvalues:
	- Added load/save_path attr
	- Using .parq not .csv

transforms.py:
	- Corrected load_path class attr
	- Used kurtosis(df) from scipy for consistency
	- cols_to_transform method now >=

exploration.py:
	- Utilised joblib for parallel task execution
	- Improved general readability
	- plt.close() added

pipeline.py:
	- Added Garabage Collection
