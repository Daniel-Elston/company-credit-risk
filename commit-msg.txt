Further-Processing:

- Further-processing and exploration is requiring further modukes and scripts than anticipated.
- As things are getting a bit messy and long, an analysis.py pipeline script will be generated in a separate branch.
- Further-processing will be stashed for now to build the analysis.py script

exploration.py:
	- evaluate_skew method added to Analysis class
	- transformation code included for quick view of effects (to be moved)
	- SkewDetector class created to focus code on skew (essentially a copy of Analysis class methods)

procesisng.py:
	- replace_outliers method added for quick handling of outliers
	- pipeline method added for modularity

build_features.py:
	- Added fillna(mean) to build_growth method

Further file adjustments:
	- config.yaml: added year parameters to easily adjust post/pre COVID19
	- config_ops.py: script for performing operations on lists/variables stored in config
