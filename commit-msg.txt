Passing Discrete:
- Passing newly formed discrete/continuous variable list
- Instead of generating sample year cols (cont. variables for a single year), continuous cols for all years generated and passed to:
	- analysis.py
	- transforms.py

transforms.py:
	- added calc_skew helper and apply_transforms method
	- cleaned pipeline method
