Statistical Analysis:
- Analysis conducted on skew and kurtosis to determine optimal transforms

statistics/statistical_analysis.py:
	- New script to house exploratory statistics, including OutlierDetection, GenerateSkewAnalysis, EvaluateSkewAnalysis classes
	- Sampling class handles generation of stratified dataframe, seed=42 added to re-generate same stratified at later stages
	- OutlierDetection class uses IQR for basic outlier detections
	- GenerateSkewAnalysis determins the skew and kurtosis before and after various transforms, for each cont. feature
	- EvaluateSkewAnalysis compiles results and determins optimal transforms for each feature
	- Results stored as .json in reports/analysis/skew_analysis/*.json and transform_map.json

exploration.py:
	- Visualiser class is the only that remains
	- Script concerned with generating figures only

processing.py:
	- StoreTransforms stores all distribution transforms for use by other scripts, and eventually, to be applied

Further:
	- trans_idx (transform_index) list stored in config
	- Further config lists added to easily group features
