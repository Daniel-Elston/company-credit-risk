Refactor Pipeline:
- General aim to clean up some code and pipeline.py flow

pipeline.py:
	- Reduced dataclass
	- Separated concerns for run_exploration and GenerateCorrAnalysis
	- run_correlation_analysis method added
	- run_eigen_analysis method added
	- Split lines for Class.pipeline() calls
	- Removed multiple run_number argument requirements

correlations.py
	- Removed run_number arguments
	- Iterating over exploration range

dist_analysis.py
	- Decomposed analyse_skew_and_kurtosis method for readability
	- List comprehension for resource
	- EvaluateDistAnalysis methods transform variable named transform_name for consistancy
	- compile and get_optimal_transform decomposed for readability

eigenvalues.py:
	- AnalyseEigenValues class object split into Generate and Evaluate classes for consistancy and separation of concerns
	-Removed analyze method

file_handler.py
	- Added save/load parquet functions
